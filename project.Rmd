# Introduction

Team A are the following members: Amal Alqahtani, Peng Jiaxiang, Elahi	Naureen, and Mu Xinya. You may find our work over on [GitHub](https://github.com/amalqahtani/Data_Science).

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world, and many risk factors have been hypothesized to affect case and death rates. We felt that a relevant discussion to have would be `What are the most regions with the highest number of deaths`? What can we say about patient demographics? Does race considered a significant risk factor for increased Covid19 incidence in the United States?' Have there been any general trends amongst the health conditions? 
These questions are all suited to EDA, and with these questions in mind, we want to see if we could find data on Covid19 that would be readily available for us to analyze. Eventually, our question morphed into the following: **What are the factors (i.e. patient demographics, social determinants of health, environmental variables, underlying health conditions, country of origin) affecting COVID-19 numbers of cases and death rate among different geographical locations in US?** 


We were able to find a dataset called `Covid-19-Dataset` on Github over here: [https://github.com/johndurbin93/Covid-19-Dataset](https://github.com/johndurbin93/Covid-19-Dataset). This dataset includes COVID-19 confirmed case number and death number through April 14, 2020  which were obtained for each U.S. county from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University. Race demographics for counties was obtained from the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps Program database. Daily temperature data for counties was obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This data was compiled by a group of reserchers. 

The report is organized as follows:

1. Summary of Dataset
2. Description of Data
3. What are the patient demographics? (demographics Data)
4. Where do ...... come from? or What are the most regions with the highest number of deaths? (country of origin Data)
5. What are the social determinants of health? (social determinants of health Data)
6. Environmental variables Data Goes Here?
7. Are there any common underlying health conditions? (health conditions Data)
8. Have there been any ....... trends among patient over the times? (Trends Over Time)
9. Are patient a certain race? (race Data)
10. Discussion And Conclusion


# Summary of Dataset

The data looks like the following:

```{r input_data}
library("readxl")
data <- read_excel("Counties_Dataset.xlsx")
summary(data)
str(data)
```

The Covid19 data has `r ncol(data)` columns and `r nrow(data)` rows/entries, for a total of `r ncol(data)*nrow(data)` individual data points. The variables are the following:

1. Province
2.
3. 
4. Total cases
5. Deaths
6. Population (for demographic %'s)
7. % less than 18 years of age 
8. % 65 and over
9. % Black
10. % American Indian & Alaska Native
11. % Asian
12. % Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander
13. % Hispanic
14. % Non-Hispanic White
15. % Not Proficient in English
16. % Female
17. 
18. Sleep <7 Hours_Percent
19. Sleep <7 Hours_CI_Low	
20. Sleep <7 Hours_CI_High	
21. Diabetes Total Percentage	
22. Diabetes Male Percentage
23. Diabetes Female Percentage
24. Coronary Heart Disease Death Rate per 100,000, All Ages , All Races/Ethnicities, Both Genders, 2014-2016
25. Hypertension Death Rate per 100,000 (any mention), 35+, All Races/Ethnicities, Both Genders, 2014-2016	
26. Obesity, Age-Adjusted Percentage, 20+. 2015	
27. % Fair or Poor Health	
28. Average Number of Physically Unhealthy Days
29. Average Number of Mentally Unhealthy Days	
30. % Low Birthweight
31. % Smokers (adults)
32. % Adults with Obesity	
33. Food Environment Index	
34. % Physically Inactive	
35. % With Access to Exercise Opportunities	
36. % Excessive Drinking	
37. % Uninsured	
38. Preventable Hospitalization Rate (Preventable hospital stays)	
39. % With Annual Mammogram	
40. % Flu Vaccinated	
41. Chronic Respiratory Disease: mortality rate per 100K (2014)	
42. Liver Disease: crude mortality rate per 100K (1999-2018)	
43. Liver Disease: % of Total Deaths (1999-2018)	
44. Liver Disease: crude mortality rate per 100K (2018)	
45. Liver Disease: % of Total Deaths (2018)
46. Avg Temp Peak Growth-10 Rate	
47. Avg Temp 10 Before First-Current	
48. Avg Temp First-Current



To prepare our data for EDA we dropped the .........: ........ NAs were also removed.
